make scoreboard work
    - show current score
    - show lives
    - show fps
    - show level reached
        - normal mode: in a tomb of 5 levels, if you're in the second one it would show "Level 2 of 5"
        - suvival mode: if player in second level, it shows "Level 2 of ???"
    - show number of tombs completed this game (normal mode only)
    - show total mummies killed this game
    - show mode

pauses:
    - pause game at beginning of each level to give player a chance to acclimatise
    - when exit opens so player doesn't blunder into it

add normal mode - you select the size of tomb you tackle (number of levels) bigger reward for more challenging tomb (bonus points and/or extra life)

add tombs
    - after a defined number of levels the player ends the tomb, mummies don't pass to the next tomb
    - tomb selection screen

add easy, medium and hard modes
    - change time it takes for tile-mummy to emerge
    - change speed of mummies
    - change availabiliy of easier tombs - maybe

sound effects
    - death
    - mummy emerges
    - start new level
    - complete level
    - use scroll
    - open exit

add new mummy types
    - design new mummies
    - determine how mummies are assigned in levels

add start screen
add mode and difficulty select screen
add tutorial
add highscore tables

add survival mode - tomb size is infinite, highest level counts for highscore table, score breaks ties


refactor the codebase lol
